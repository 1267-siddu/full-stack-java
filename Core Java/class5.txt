Identifiers
============
A name in java is called identifier.

It can be class name, variable name , method name or label name.

ex:
	class Test
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			int  x = 10;

			System.out.println(x); 
		}
	}

	Here Test, main , args and x are identifiers.

Rules to declare an identifiers
===============================
Rule1:
------
	Identifier will accept following characters.
	ex:
		A-Z
		a-z
		0-9
		_
		$

Rule2:
------
	If we take other characters then we will get compile time error.
	ex:
		int  emp#id; //invalid 
		int  emp_id; //valid 
		int  emp$al; //valid 

Rule3:
-----
	Identifier must and should starts with alphabet, underscore or dollar symbol but not 
	with digit.
	ex:
		int  a1234;  //valid 
		int  _abcd;  //valid 
		int  $alary; //valid 
		int  1abcd;  //invalid 

Rule4:
-----
	We can't take reserved words as an identifier name.
	ex:
		int  if; //invalid 
		int  else; //invalid 
		int  for; //invalid 
		
Rule5:
------
	There is no length limit for an identifier but it is not recommanded to take 
	more then 15 characters.


Rule6:
------
	Every identifier is a case sensitive.
	ex:
		int  number;
		int  NUMBER;
		int  NumBer;

Rule7:
------
	We can take predefined classes and interfaces as an identifier name but it is not 
	good programming practice.
	ex:
		int   String=10;  //valid 
		int   Runnable=20;  //valid 


Reserved words
==============
There are some identifiers which are reserved to associate some functionality or meaning such type of identifiers are called reserved words.

Java supports 53 reserved words.

All reserved words we need to write under lowercase letters only.

In java, reserved words are divided into two types.
