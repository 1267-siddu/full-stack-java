OOPS
====
OOPS stands for Object Oriented Programming System/Structure.

The purpose of OOPS is to deal with real world entities using programming language. 

We have following list of OOPS features.

1) class 

2) object 

3) Abstraction 

4) Encapsulation 

5) Inheritance 

6) Polymorhism 


object oriented technology
-------------------------
A technology which provides very good environment to represent our data in the form objects is called object oriented technology.



class
======
A class is a blue print of an object.

A class is a collection of variables and methods.

A class is a logical entity.

We can declare a class as follow.

syntax:
	optional 
	|
	modifier  class   class_name <extends> Parent_classname
			   	     <implements> Interface_name
	{
		-
		- //variables
		- // methods 
		-
	}

A class will accept following modifiers.
ex:
	default
	public
	private 
	protected


Realtime example
----------------
To construct a building we required a design and that design is a class.


Q) What is difference between default class and public class?

default class
-------------
If we declare any class as default then we can access that class within the package.

ex:
	class A 
	{
		-
		- //variables and methods 
		-	
	}

public class
------------
If we declare any class as public then we can access that class within the package and outside the package.

ex:
	public class A 
	{
		-
		- //variables and methods 
		-
	}


Q) What is final class?

If we declare any class as final then creating child class is not possible.

ex:
	final class A 
	{
		-
	}
	class B extends A ---> invalid 
	{
		-
	}

Q) What is abstract class?

If we declare any class as abstract then creating object for that class is not possible.

ex:
	abstract class A
	{
		-
	}
	A a=new A(); --> invalid 


object
=======
It is a outcome of a blue print.

It is a instance of a class.

Here instance means allocating memory for our data members.

It is a physical entity.

It is a collection of properties and behaviours.

We can create object as follow.

ex:
			operator 
			   |
	Test    t     =    new      Test();
	|       |			|
    classname  reference variable   constructor

Memory space will be allocated when we create an object. 

It is possible to create more then on object in a single class.


Realtime example
----------------
				Dog (object)
				|
		-----------------------------------------
		|					|
	properties					behaviours
	
	> Height 					> Eating 
	> Age						> Sleeping 
	> Color						> Barking 
	> Weight 					> Running 
	> Width 					and etc.
	and etc.

ex:
---
public class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Test t1=new Test();
		Test t2=new Test();
		Test t3=new Test();

		System.out.println(t1.hashCode());
		System.out.println(t2.hashCode());
		System.out.println(t3.hashCode());

		System.out.println(t1); //Test@Hexadecimalno
		System.out.println(t2.toString());
		System.out.println(t3.toString());
	}
}


Q) What is hash code in java?

For every object JVM will create a unique identification number i.e hash code.

In order to read hash code of an object we will use hashCode() method.

Diagram: class27.1


toString() 
==========
It is a method present in Object class.

Whenever we are trying to display any object reference. Directly or indirectly toString() method will be executed.




Q) Which class consider as parent class in java?

Object class consider as parent class in java.

Object class present in java.lang package.

Object class contains following methods.

ex:
	cmd>javap   java.lang.Object


	ex:
		hashCode()
		toString()
		notify()
		notifyAll()
		wait()
		getClass()
		and etc.
		


Data Hiding
============
Data hiding is used to provide security to the program by hiding object data.

Using private modifier we can implements data hiding concept.

Data hiding is used to prevent unauthorized data access.

ex:

class Account 
{
	//instance variable
	private double balance=20000;
}
class Customer 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Account a=new Account();
		System.out.println(a.balance);
	}
}
C.T.E : balance has private access in Account
