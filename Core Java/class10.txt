Main method
===========
Our program contains main method or not.Either it is propery declare or not. It is not a responsibility of a compiler to check.It is a liability of a JVM to check for main method.

If JVM won't find main method then it will throw one runtime error called main method not found.

JVM looks for main method with following signature.
ex:
	public static void main(String[] args)

If we perform any changes in above signature then JVM will throw one runtime error called 
main method not found.


Q) Can you explain main method in java?

public
-----
	JVM wants to call this method from anywhere.

static
------
	JVM wants to call this method without using object reference.

void
-----
	Main method does not return anything to JVM

main
----
	It is an identifier given to a main method.

String[] args
-----------
	It is a command line argument.

We can perform following changes in main.


1) Order of modifiers is not important.Incase of public static we can take static public also.
   ex:
	static public void main(String[] args)


2) We can declare String[] in following acceptable formats.
   ex:
	public static void main(String[] args)
	public static void main(String   []args)
	public static void main(String  args[])

3) We can replace String[] with var-arg parameter.
   ex:
	public static void main(String... args)


4) We can replace args with any java valid identifier.
   ex:
	public static void main(String[]  ihub)	


5) Main method will accept following modifiers.
   ex:
	synchronized 
	strictfp 
	final 


Command Line Argument
=====================
Arguments which are passing through command prompt such type of arguments are called command line arguments.

In command line arguments we need to ask input values at runtime command.

ex:
	javac   Test.java 

	java    Test  101  raja   M  1000.0
			|   |	  |	|___args[3]
			|   |	  |_________args[2]
			|   |_______________args[1]
			|___________________args[0]

ex:
---
class Test
{
	public static  void main(String[]  args)	
	{
		System.out.println(args[0]);
		System.out.println(args[1]);
		System.out.println(args[2]);
		System.out.println(args[3]);		
	}
}

Interview Questions
====================

Q) How many modules are there in java?

   We have three modules in java.
   1) JSE/J2SE
   2) JEE/J2EE
   3) JME/J2ME 			

	 	
	
Q) What is Literal?

It is a synthetic representation of boolean, character, numeric, or string data. 

A value which we assign to a variable is called literal.

A value which is not change during the program execution is called literal.

ex:
	int  i = 10;
	 |   |	  |__value of a variable / Literal 
	 |   |_______variable name / Identifier 
	 |___________datatype / keyword 



Q) What is Java ? 

It is a object oriented, platform independent, case sensitive, strongly typed checking,
high level, open source programming language developed by James Gosling in the year of 1995.

or

It is a versatile programming language which is used to develop various types of applications.
