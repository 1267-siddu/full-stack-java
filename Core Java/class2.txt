Naming Conventions in java
==========================
In java, uppercase letters will consider as different and lowercase letters will consider as different that why we consider java is a case sensitive programming language.

As java is a case sensitive we must and should follow naming conventions for following things.

ex:
	classes
	interfaces
	variables
	methods 
	keywords
	packages
	and 
	constants 

classes
---------
In java, a class name must and should starts with uppercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined classes		Userdefined classes
	------------------		--------------------
	System				Test
	File				DemoApp
	FileWriter 			ExampleApp
	BufferedReader			TestApp
	ArrayList 			ReverseNumber
	and etc.			and etc.

interfaces
----------
In java ,an interface name must and should starts with capital letter and if it is having multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap. 

ex:
	predefined interfaces		userdefined interfaces
	----------------------		----------------------
	Runnable 			ITest	
	Serializable 			IDemoApp
	Iterator			IExampleApp
	ListIterator 			IReverseNumber
	Enumeration 			and etc.
	and etc.

variables
---------
In java, a variable name must and should starts with lowercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined variables		userdefined variables
	--------------------		---------------------
	out				i
	in				x
	err				empId
	length				studName
	and etc.			deptNo 
					and etc.

methods
--------
In java , a method name must and should starts with lowercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined methods		userdefined methods
	------------------		------------------
	getClass()			getDetails()	
	hashCode()			calculatBillAmt()
	toString()			getInfo()
	setName()			setStudentInfo()
	getPriority()			fetchDetails()
	and etc.			and etc.

keywords
----------
In java, all keywords we need to declare under lowercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined keywords
	-------------------
	if, else, public, static , void , for, do , while, switch and etc.

packages
--------
In java, all packages we need to declare under lowercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined packages		userdefined packages
	-----------------		--------------------
	java.lang (default pkg)		ihub
	java.io				com.ihub.www
	java.util			google	
	java.util.stream		com.google.www
	java.text			and etc.
	java.time
	java.sql
	javax.servlet 
	and etc.

constants
---------
In java, all constants we need to write under uppercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined constants		userdefined constants
	--------------------		---------------------
	MAX_PRIORITY			N=10;
	MIN_PRIORITY			LIMIT=10;
	NORM_PRIORITY
	MAX_VALUE
	MIN_VALUE
	and etc.
